## Basic usage
```LUA
local console = require "console" -- Require the console

--[[ Note that if you want to print messages using a command
     such as the "print" command included in the exemple, 
     you'll have to require the console in a global variable. ]]

function love.load()
    console.registercallbacks() -- Register all required callbacks for the console

    --[[ If you wish to use a gamestate library such as hump.gamestate
         you should execute this function after the one from the library
         otherwise the console will not display in a correct way.
         In an other hand, you can call each console's callbacks manually. ]]

    console.print("Super cool message!") -- Prints a message
end
```

### Print from a thread
```LUA
local console = require "console"

-- Initialize the thread code
local code = [[
-- Require the thread version of the console,
-- this version only contain the console.print() function.
local console = require "console.thread"

local str = ... -- Get the argument

console.print(str) -- Prints a message to the console
]]

thread = love.thread.newThread(code)

function love.load()
    console.registercallbacks()

    thread:start("An other cool message!")
    --[[ Starts the thread with an argument which will be used to print a message.
         The console automatically create a channel that will be used for that,
         the channel is called "console_channel". ]]
end
```
